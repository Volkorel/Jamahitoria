EVTDESC99939;The tenacious farmers of Transvaal and Oranje Free State have been a source of frustration for us ever since we set foot upon the arid landscapes of this untamed continent.\nDisplaying a fervent sense of patriotism, verging on radicalism, these farmers, known as Granjeros, have been clamoring for privileges that were previously bestowed upon them by the Catalan settlers. However, in a seemingly impetuous manner, the Granjeros have now turned their backs on our nation, relinquishing any hope of garnering recognition from both our central government and our colonial authorities.\n\nDubbed "la Gran Caminata," or the Great Journey, this mass exodus sees virtually every Granjero within our borders embarking on an arduous trek from Kaapsted to the capital of the Shona tribe, Harare, which they have christened "Esperanza Ciudad," meaning the City of Hope.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99939_NEWS_LONG;The resolute Granjeros of Transvaal and Oranje Free State, a perpetual thorn in Frysk colonies, have forsaken Frysk nation and colonial governments. Their patriotic and perhaps radical demands for privileges, previously granted by Catalan colonists, have been abandoned. Termed "la Gran Caminata'' or the Great Journey, this mass migration sees Granjeros trekking from Kaapsted to Harare, the capital of the Shona tribe, establishing their own independent nation called "Esperanza Ciudad" or Hope's City. This ambitious endeavor, named after the founder of a defunct Catalan mining company, Cecil Rhodes, aims to populate South Africa to its fullest extent, creating Rodesia. Local tribes view this development with discontent, as the Granjeros' aspirations clash with their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Liberal administration lodged charges asserting that Jarl Tuttunnakkassitt, head of Haida Company, had provided campaign funds to Ingard in exchange for a guaranteed contract with his firm.

EVTNAME44117;Unitarianism in Hroudsted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44117;The rise of numerous sects within Meinwerkist Christianity in Hroudsted in the early 19th Century would create an environment for further theological speculation. One of the most influential movements to arise from this would be Hroud Unitarianism. Emphasizing the role of reason in understanding theology (and thus rejecting the concept of the Trinity) and the inherent goodness of humanity and its capability for improvement because of reason, Unitarianism would become very influential among middle and upper-class populations in the Northeastern Hroudsted and encourage several movements of social improvement, from public education to abolitionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44118;The Benevolent Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44118;One direct impact of the religious revival in the Hroudsted in the early nineteenth century would be the explosion in the number of voluntary organizations organized to help improve society by tackling perceived social or moral problems in society, providing comfort to the less fortunate, or promoting self-help via education.

EVTNAME16180;Free Staters;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16180;During the most intense days of the slavery debate, some abolitionists organized emigration to the territories of Bliedend and Kusabo in order to prevent these territories from being admitted into the Dominion as slave-states. The theory of popular sovereignty held that a democratic vote in the state would decide on whether the state should be constituted as slave or free. These abolitionists were called Free Staters, and some of them have now turned up in a few states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The moniker came originally from Unionists likening them to poisonous snakes, but it soon struck home with the Copperheads themselves. While there is no war yet, there is staunch resistance to abolitionism within some democratic circles in a few states.

EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Scotland and predicted disaster: the Scottish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Scottish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Scottish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez-faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Scottish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the_aceh_question_title;The Adaman Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the_aceh_question_desc;For much of the 19th century, Adaman's ownership by the Norse had been guaranteed by the Vinlandic-Frysk Treaty of 1824 and its status as a protectorate of Vinland since the late 1700s. During the 1820s, the Sultanate of Adaman became a regional political and commercial power, supplying half of the world's pepper, which increased the revenues and influence of local feudal rajahs. Following the opening of the Suez Canal, the trade routes shifted and we are now in a position to strike a deal with the civilized protectors of the Adaman: allow us a free hand within their sphere of influence in Maritime Southeast Asia while we also take the responsibility to fight piracy in the region. With this deal we might get their sanction to conquer Adaman, though we should be ready to give something in return, most probably a colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

embrace_the_boer_title;Make Amends with the Granjeros;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embrace_the_boer_desc;Our rule in South Africa was tyrannical: we closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in our own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded from them a large part of their produce, and harassed them with other exactions tending to discourage industry and enterprise. The effect of this tyranny was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and thus Caminata began. The colony policies changed hands but many of the Granjeros farmers were as dissatisfied with Transvaal rule as they had been with the Frysk central rule, though their ground of complaint was not the same. By making amends with the Granjeros farmers, paying compensation, abolishing former tyrannical rule and administrating the colonies directly, we can make amends and make the Granjeros accept our rule, to finally put an end to the trekking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
first_annexiation_limburg_title;The Liege Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
first_annexiation_limburg_desc;With the end of the Lorraine-led customs union known as East Frankia Confederation and the rise of a modern, intertwined German state, the duchy of Liege became an outdated promise - one that was part of the defunct East Frank Confederation. Liege is internationally recognized as an integral part of the Wallonia but as the Germans set their eyes and ambitions on the complete unification of all German Confederation states, the duchy became a dangerous compromise. Several senior figures in $CAPITAL$ are preparing an order for the $MONARCHTITLE$ to sign, declaring the extinction of the old duchy of Liege and its full integration in the Friesland. The Germans, however, might try to protest this move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME952514;The Duchy of Liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC952514;With the union of the German Confederation in a more unified state, an old member of the Confederation, the Duchy of Liege, which was created to fill the spot of Liege per the London Treaty, had its autonomy revoked and it's being annexed by the Friesland. Our claim in the region is tenuous, but it exists and we could push for it. If we decide to do it, we have six months to stall the Friesland before they annex Liege, and other great powers might try to intervene, but if we succeed, liberate Liege and bring them in our sphere, we will be able to annex it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT952514OPTA;Let it go. We recognized the territory as part of the Friesland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT952514OPTB;A state that once was part of the Confederation is a part of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME952515;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Claims;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC952515;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ are claiming Liege on the basis of their customs union. They don't have much time to press their claims, as they are not strong claims. Other great powers might declare their support for us if they try anything. Our advisors expect that any movement to annex Liege right now is being blocked by $FROMCOUNTRY$, but if we manage to keep Liege under our vassalage for six months we will be able to annex Liege and solve this crisis our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT952515OPTA;Damn $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME952516;The End of the Liege Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC952516;The Liege crisis arose from German ambitions over the old duchy of Liege. Wherever they enforced their claims or not, the question is now, for better or worse, gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME952517;The Liege Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC952517;The Germans of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are claiming the Duchy of Liege as part of their territory. This is started because of the Frysk move to annex the territory as the fall of the East Frank customs union created a fear of a German claim in the area. The Frysk will surely fall if they have to fend the Germans by themselves but they only need six months to finish annexing the territory. As Great Power, we need to declare our position on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT952517OPTA;German violation of Frysk territory will not be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT952517OPTB;We don't want to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

accept_the_flemish_desc;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ made several mistakes when dealing with the Walloons. The Calvinist/Catholic divide and political ostracization, among other things, led to the Belgian Revolution. It's time we try and repair our relationship, implement effective freedom of religion and give them equal rights. Bowing down to them will dent our international prestige, but it will allow us to live in peace once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
