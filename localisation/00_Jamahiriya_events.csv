EVTDESC99939;The tenacious farmers of Transvaal and Oranje Free State have been a source of frustration for us ever since we set foot upon the arid landscapes of this untamed continent.\nDisplaying a fervent sense of patriotism, verging on radicalism, these farmers, known as Granjeros, have been clamoring for privileges that were previously bestowed upon them by the Catalan settlers. However, in a seemingly impetuous manner, the Granjeros have now turned their backs on our nation, relinquishing any hope of garnering recognition from both our central government and our colonial authorities.\n\nDubbed "la Gran Caminata," or the Great Journey, this mass exodus sees virtually every Granjero within our borders embarking on an arduous trek from Kaapsted to the capital of the Shona tribe, Harare, which they have christened "Esperanza Ciudad," meaning the City of Hope.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99939_NEWS_LONG;The resolute Granjeros of Transvaal and Oranje Free State, a perpetual thorn in Frysk colonies, have forsaken Frysk nation and colonial governments. Their patriotic and perhaps radical demands for privileges, previously granted by Catalan colonists, have been abandoned. Termed "la Gran Caminata'' or the Great Journey, this mass migration sees Granjeros trekking from Kaapsted to Harare, the capital of the Shona tribe, establishing their own independent nation called "Esperanza Ciudad" or Hope's City. This ambitious endeavor, named after the founder of a defunct Catalan mining company, Cecil Rhodes, aims to populate South Africa to its fullest extent, creating Rodesia. Local tribes view this development with discontent, as the Granjeros' aspirations clash with their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Feeling threatened both politically and economically by the ideology and tenants of liberalism, and feeling special hatred for the anti-clerical Fatimids, who are clearly masonic puppets, with their hatred of church and tradition. They feel that true security can only come about through strong rule by the true heir of Infante Don Carlos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC37711;The death of King Ferdinand in 1833 and the ascension of young Isabela (only three years old at the time) to the throne of Iberia sparked a revolt by supporters of the King's brother, Abu Carlos. He intends to depose Isabela and establish a separate branch of the al-Borbon family, as well as restore the Iberian Empire to its traditional glory and Christianity -- something liberals say simply cannot be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99941;Intervention to the Empire War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99941;The illustrious Empire of Armagnacée, under its newly established monarchy, has made the audacious proclamation of asserting dominion over the entire Flakten region, incorporating it as an integral part of the Armagnacéoise Empire. The valiant Tayshans, who have repeatedly defended themselves against the Armagnacéoise forces throughout history, including the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars era, now find themselves in a state of desperate vulnerability as they confront this latest challenge alone.\n\nContemplating the situation at hand, a pivotal question arises: should we, as external entities, intervene in this conflict? Shall we align ourselves with the ambitious Armagnacée, driven by the pursuit of territorial expansion, or shall we extend our support to the beleaguered Taysha, recognizing the gravity of their plight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
