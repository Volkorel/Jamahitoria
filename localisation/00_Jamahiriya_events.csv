EVTDESC99939;The tenacious farmers of Transvaal and Oranje Free State have been a source of frustration for us ever since we set foot upon the arid landscapes of this untamed continent.\nDisplaying a fervent sense of patriotism, verging on radicalism, these farmers, known as Granjeros, have been clamoring for privileges that were previously bestowed upon them by the Catalan settlers. However, in a seemingly impetuous manner, the Granjeros have now turned their backs on our nation, relinquishing any hope of garnering recognition from both our central government and our colonial authorities.\n\nDubbed "la Gran Caminata," or the Great Journey, this mass exodus sees virtually every Granjero within our borders embarking on an arduous trek from Kaapsted to the capital of the Shona tribe, Harare, which they have christened "Esperanza Ciudad," meaning the City of Hope.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99939_NEWS_LONG;The resolute Granjeros of Transvaal and Oranje Free State, a perpetual thorn in Frysk colonies, have forsaken Frysk nation and colonial governments. Their patriotic and perhaps radical demands for privileges, previously granted by Catalan colonists, have been abandoned. Termed "la Gran Caminata'' or the Great Journey, this mass migration sees Granjeros trekking from Kaapsted to Harare, the capital of the Shona tribe, establishing their own independent nation called "Esperanza Ciudad" or Hope's City. This ambitious endeavor, named after the founder of a defunct Catalan mining company, Cecil Rhodes, aims to populate South Africa to its fullest extent, creating Rodesia. Local tribes view this development with discontent, as the Granjeros' aspirations clash with their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99941;The illustrious Empire of Armagnacée, under its newly established monarchy, has made the audacious proclamation of asserting dominion over the entire Flakten region, incorporating it as an integral part of the Armagnacéoise Empire. The valiant Tayshans, who have repeatedly defended themselves against the Armagnacéoise forces throughout history, including the tumultuous Napoleonic Wars era, now find themselves in a state of desperate vulnerability as they confront this latest challenge alone.\n\nContemplating the situation at hand, a pivotal question arises: should we, as external entities, intervene in this conflict?

EVTDESC44300;Following the triumphant ascent of the Conservative administration to a parliamentary majority in 1872, a torrent of grave accusations was directed towards Ingard Hoel-Land, casting a shadow of uncertainty over his reputation. At the center of these allegations lay Ingard's ambitious undertaking, the construction of the trans-continental railway. The Liberal administration lodged charges asserting that Jarl Tuttunnakkassitt, head of Haida Company, had provided campaign funds to Ingard in exchange for a guaranteed contract with his firm. Despite Ingard's vehement proclamations of innocence, the mounting pressure compelled him to relinquish his position as Prime Minister.

In protest the Blandett people, led by Sigfrid Rielsson, revolted. Sigfrid was a highly religious man, who had studied for the clergy in his earlier life. He fought for the Blandett people and became a hero in the eyes of Manitobans. Sigfrid bargained with the Vinlandic government for Manitoba's entry into it's own jarldom.
