EVTDESC99939;The tenacious farmers of Transvaal and Oranje Free State have been a source of frustration for us ever since we set foot upon the arid landscapes of this untamed continent.\nDisplaying a fervent sense of patriotism, verging on radicalism, these farmers, known as Granjeros, have been clamoring for privileges that were previously bestowed upon them by the Catalan settlers. However, in a seemingly impetuous manner, the Granjeros have now turned their backs on our nation, relinquishing any hope of garnering recognition from both our central government and our colonial authorities.\n\nDubbed "la Gran Caminata," or the Great Journey, this mass exodus sees virtually every Granjero within our borders embarking on an arduous trek from Kaapsted to the capital of the Shona tribe, Harare, which they have christened "Esperanza Ciudad," meaning the City of Hope.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99939_NEWS_LONG;The resolute Granjeros of Transvaal and Oranje Free State, a perpetual thorn in Frysk colonies, have forsaken Frysk nation and colonial governments. Their patriotic and perhaps radical demands for privileges, previously granted by Catalan colonists, have been abandoned. Termed "la Gran Caminata'' or the Great Journey, this mass migration sees Granjeros trekking from Kaapsted to Harare, the capital of the Shona tribe, establishing their own independent nation called "Esperanza Ciudad" or Hope's City. This ambitious endeavor, named after the founder of a defunct Catalan mining company, Cecil Rhodes, aims to populate South Africa to its fullest extent, creating Rodesia. Local tribes view this development with discontent, as the Granjeros' aspirations clash with their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
