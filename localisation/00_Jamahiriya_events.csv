EVTDESC99939;The tenacious farmers of Transvaal and Oranje Free State have been a source of frustration for us ever since we set foot upon the arid landscapes of this untamed continent.\nDisplaying a fervent sense of patriotism, verging on radicalism, these farmers, known as Granjeros, have been clamoring for privileges that were previously bestowed upon them by the Catalan settlers. However, in a seemingly impetuous manner, the Granjeros have now turned their backs on our nation, relinquishing any hope of garnering recognition from both our central government and our colonial authorities.\n\nDubbed "la Gran Caminata," or the Great Journey, this mass exodus sees virtually every Granjero within our borders embarking on an arduous trek from Kaapsted to the capital of the Shona tribe, Harare, which they have christened "Esperanza Ciudad," meaning the City of Hope.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99939_NEWS_LONG;The resolute Granjeros of Transvaal and Oranje Free State, a perpetual thorn in Frysk colonies, have forsaken Frysk nation and colonial governments. Their patriotic and perhaps radical demands for privileges, previously granted by Catalan colonists, have been abandoned. Termed "la Gran Caminata'' or the Great Journey, this mass migration sees Granjeros trekking from Kaapsted to Harare, the capital of the Shona tribe, establishing their own independent nation called "Esperanza Ciudad" or Hope's City. This ambitious endeavor, named after the founder of a defunct Catalan mining company, Cecil Rhodes, aims to populate South Africa to its fullest extent, creating Rodesia. Local tribes view this development with discontent, as the Granjeros' aspirations clash with their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Liberal administration lodged charges asserting that Jarl Tuttunnakkassitt, head of Haida Company, had provided campaign funds to Ingard in exchange for a guaranteed contract with his firm.

EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16001;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16001;The one issue that the Hroudsted Convention never able to answer conclusively, was the question concerning the status of slavery within the nation. This inflamed debate has only gained traction in the years since the revolution, and it is presently the singular most important issue on our country's political agenda. Some radical southerners feel that there is no possible compromise to be found on the issue, and that secession is the only alternative to being dominated into emancipation by the central power in Wassyngton. Should our Senate ever be in a position to force political reform on the South, a 40 percent Liberal Upper House, we can be certain that it will not happen without opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44117;Unitarianism in Hroudsted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44117;The rise of numerous sects within Meinwerkist Christianity in Hroudsted in the early 19th Century would create an environment for further theological speculation. One of the most influential movements to arise from this would be Hroud Unitarianism. Emphasizing the role of reason in understanding theology (and thus rejecting the concept of the Trinity) and the inherent goodness of humanity and its capability for improvement because of reason, Unitarianism would become very influential among middle and upper-class populations in the Northeastern Hroudsted and encourage several movements of social improvement, from public education to abolitionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44117;Faith and reason can be reconciled to improve humanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44118;The Benevolent Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44118;One direct impact of the religious revival in the Hroudsted in the early nineteenth century would be the explosion in the number of voluntary organizations organized to help improve society by tackling perceived social or moral problems in society, providing comfort to the less fortunate, or promoting self-help via education. Dubbed 'The Benevolent Empire' by historians, these organizations helped provide a community infrastructure for a society rapidly expanding in numbers and being transformed by new economic forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44120;Moral Crusaders;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44120;One of the impacts of the religious revival in the Hroudsted in the early 19th Century would be sustained campaigns against perceived vices by those who believed they were doing God's work by attempting to stamp out such behavior.

EVTDESC44121;Established in 1816 as by Afro-Norse members of the Methodist community of Nassau, in the 1830s and 1840s the HME Church would rapidly expand its membership among both free and slave populations in Hroudsted during the era of religious revival, providing a spiritual outlet for the Afro-Norse community completely under their own control and direction and a new platform for challenging the continued practice of slavery in the Dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME16180;Free Staters;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16180;During the most intense days of the slavery debate, some abolitionists organized emigration to the territories of Bliedend and Kusabo in order to prevent these territories from being admitted into the Dominion as slave-states. The theory of popular sovereignty held that a democratic vote in the state would decide on whether the state should be constituted as slave or free. These abolitionists were called Free Staters, and some of them have now turned up in a few states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16150;The 'Copperheads' were a group of Democrats in the Northern Hroudsted who, during the Civil War, opposed the war, and favored a peace settlement with the South. The moniker came originally from Unionists likening them to poisonous snakes, but it soon struck home with the Copperheads themselves. While there is no war yet, there is staunch resistance to abolitionism within some democratic circles in a few states. Stepping up the local political campaigning could probably neutralize them, but only at the cost of offending southern sentiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
